 <p> The character Byomkesh Baskshi created by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay. The writer descrive this character as "SATYANWESHI" not a detective. In this movie Arindam sil also descrive in the same way. The government of Bengal asks Byomkesh Bakshi (Abir) to investigate reports about illegal arms circulating in the picturesque Dooars town of Santagola. The prime suspects are four affluent members of the town: Biswanath Mullick (Kaushik), Badrinath Das (Rajatava), Nafor Kundu (Subhasis) and Jamunadas Gangaram (Ashok Singh). But the plot thickens when village lad Amrito (Deboprasad) and quack, Sadananda Sur (Rudranil) are murdered.</p>
 <p> According to the performance, Abir Chatterjee plays the polite,soft and swift sleuth perfectly. Sohini Sarkar and Ritwick Chakraborty(Ajit) play their supporting roles appropriately. While Sohini Sarkar does complete justice to her role of the perennially-waiting Satyabati, Ritwick Chakraborty is at his usual best as Ajit.</p> 
 <p> I think noone wants to miss this type of mystery story. Noone can leave this type of movie before end. Everyone wants to watch this movie again and again.</p>
